Implemented the following JavaScript functions using Test Driven Development (TDD) approach facilitated with Jest:<br>
 - **capitalize -** A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
 - **reverseString -** - A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
 - **calculator -** An object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
 - **caesarCipher -** function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
 - **analyzeArray -** function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
